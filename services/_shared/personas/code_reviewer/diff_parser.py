"""Pure unified-diff parser for the Elder (code-reviewer) persona.

Takes a unified-diff string fetched from `GET .../pulls/{n}` (Accept:
application/vnd.github.diff) and extracts structured hunks. Pure: no IO,
no logging side-effects, no hidden globals. Spec 0015 §Parse contract.

Why a hand-rolled parser and not unidiff/pypatch:
- Both services ship as Lambda images; every dep adds cold-start weight.
  The unified-diff subset we actually need is small (~80 lines) — fewer
  than the dep would add to requirements.
- We need to track new-side line numbers for hallucination filtering
  (see `new_lines`), which most third-party parsers expose awkwardly.
- Pure-function purity is attestable by spec; an opaque dep wouldn't be.

    `new_lines` is the set of new-side line numbers that are added OR

    hallucination filter (`evaluate_diff`) rejects LLM findings whose
    `(file, line)` is not in any hunk's `new_lines` — a finding on a
    line the LLM couldn't have seen is almost certainly invented.

    `body` retains the raw @@-prefixed hunk text for feeding back to
    the LLM as review context (matches `llm_client.Hunk(path, body)`).

    Invariants enforced in `__post_init__`: non-empty `file_path`,
    `new_start >= 1` (1-based line numbers per unified-diff spec),
    `body` starts with `@@`. Each invariant catches a parser regression
    at the boundary rather than letting a malformed hunk reach the LLM.
    They raise `DiffParseError` — NOT `assert` — because the dispatch
    degrade contract only catches DiffParseError: an AssertionError here
