"""Guard hygiene watch (#655, epic #654) - the owned CI-hygiene pass.

The fleet already lints CI hygiene at DIFF time: a PR touching `.github/`
gets checked for unbounded jobs, unbounded `curl`, and floating action
refs. But a violation that merged before the linter existed sits silent
forever - nothing re-reads the DEFAULT BRANCH. This scheduled pass closes
that gap, the same way `dep_watch.py` (#491) closed it for dependency
pins: grug-poller cadence, store-driven targeting, weekly claim, ONE
quarantine-style report issue per repo, refreshed rather than duplicated.

Third instance of a template built twice already (`pulse/nudge.py` #472,
`guard/dep_watch.py` #491), so it deliberately copies their shape:
per-repo flag defaulting OFF, best-effort per repo, marker-based issue
identity, read-before-claim.

Rules mirror the diff-time linter's semantics, INCLUDING its escape
hatches - a repo that opted a line out at diff time must not be nagged
about it weekly:

  - `runs-on:` job with no `timeout-minutes:`. Reusable-caller jobs
    (top-level `uses:`, no `runs-on:`) are exempt; their timeout lives in
    the reusable. Opt out with `# hygiene: allow-no-timeout-minutes`.
  - `curl` in a `run:` block without BOTH a total bound (`--max-time`/`-m`)
    and a connect bound (`--connect-timeout`). Backslash continuations are
    one command; a curl quoted in a `description:` block scalar is prose.
    Opt out with `# hygiene: allow-curl-no-timeout` on any line of the
    command or the line above it.
  - third-party `uses: owner/repo@ref` where ref is not a full 40-hex SHA.
    Local composites (`./.github/actions/...`) have no pinning concern.
  - dead infrastructure references in LIVE (non-comment) code.

DEAD-REFERENCE PATTERNS ARE NOT SHIPPED HERE, and that is deliberate.
The diff-time linter carries a concrete list, but those strings are one
operator's private cluster paths and grug is a PUBLIC repo - hardcoding
them would leak private infrastructure names to every reader and would be
wrong for every other install anyway. `scan_dead_refs` therefore takes
the patterns as an argument. They come from the per-repo config surface
(#778): `guard_hygiene_dead_ref_patterns` in the store, set per-install
via `set_repo_config` (see docs/SELF_HOST.md - the data cannot ship in
this repo, so a third-party install configures its own list there). A
repo with the category enabled but no patterns configured is VISIBLE as
such, not silently clean: `run_hygiene_watch_for_install` logs
`hygiene_watch_dead_ref_unconfigured` and, when it files a report at all
(other categories found something), the report body says so too.

Each scan function is pure `(path, text) -> tuple[Violation, ...]` so it
is unit-testable against fixture content with no network.
