"""Chief ticket-compliance: does a PR's diff address the acceptance
criteria of the issue it claims to close? (#529, epic #522.)

The PR-side twin of the close-completeness guard (which reopens an ISSUE
whose acceptance boxes are unchecked at close). Here, when a PR says
`closes #N`, Chief compares #N's acceptance-criteria checkboxes against
the PR's diff signals and flags criteria that look unaddressed - an
advisory nudge, never a gate.

All pure: the dispatch gathers the facts (PR body, linked-issue body,
changed file paths) and these functions decide. The heuristic is
deliberately CONSERVATIVE - a criterion is flagged unaddressed ONLY when
NONE of its distinctive tokens appear anywhere in the diff signals, so
the false-positive rate the issue warns about stays low.

# Bug (found 2026-07-24, live audit of grug#730/PR#734): this list used to be
# a small hand-rolled set that MISSED ordinary English connectors like "but"
# and "after" - so e.g. issue #730's unchecked criterion "Failure after model
# completion but before publication is observable..." spuriously overlapped
# a PR body/diff that never touched retry/idempotency at all, just because
# "after" and "but" showed up somewhere incidental. Since `unaddressed_criteria`
# only flags a criterion when its token set is NON-empty AND has ZERO overlap
# with the diff signals, under-stopping can only ever suppress real findings
# (spurious "addressed" matches) - it can never manufacture a false positive,
# so this list should err toward completeness. Now a standard English
# stopword set (NLTK's default `stopwords.words("english")`) merged with the
# original domain-specific additions. The tokenizer (`_TOKEN_RE`) doesn't
# match apostrophes, so contractions split at the apostrophe (e.g. "don't"
# -> "don" + "t") - the stemmed halves are included below too.
