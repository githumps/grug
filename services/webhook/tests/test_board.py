"""Unified review board: one comment per PR, one email per PR.

The properties worth pinning are the ones that make the board SAFE to have
several personas writing into the same comment concurrently:
  - a persona rewrites only the bytes between its own delimiters
  - order is fixed, so the comment does not reshuffle between passes
  - an unknown section from a newer/older grug is preserved, never dropped
