    """Live audit finding (2026-07-24): grug#730's 6 acceptance criteria
    against the real PR #734 diff. #734 genuinely shipped capture + stack
    refresh (criteria 1-3, 6) and deliberately deferred idempotent retry +
    failure-recoverability to a follow-up issue (#738) - but Chief never
    posted an advisory despite the gap, for two compounding reasons:

    1. A stopword gap ("but"/"after" weren't in _STOP) let pure connector
       words count as "overlap" - fixed by completing the stopword list.
    2. A single shared content word was enough to call a criterion
       "addressed" - fixed by requiring >=2 overlapping tokens (see
       _MIN_MATCH_TOKENS).

    Both fixes together now correctly flag criterion 4 (retry/idempotency
    - its only real overlap was the single generic word "findings", which
    every criterion in this issue happens to share). Criterion 5 (failure
    recovery) is a KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP this heuristic still misses: the
    real PR body's unrelated "capture failure" sentence coincidentally
    supplies two of criterion 5's words ("failure", "publication") for a
    reason that has nothing to do with the criterion. A deterministic
    bag-of-words heuristic can't reliably tell "these words co-occur
    because the behavior was built" from "these words co-occur because
    the feature area shares vocabulary" - that's exactly why this advisory
    is a nudge, never a gate, and why the real backstop for this class of
    miss is Elder's own structured, severity-tagged findings (see the
    Living-Hunt cumulative-verdict fix), not smarter prose-similarity."""
