"""Structured-logging guard (2026-07-24 audit): a bare `logging.basicConfig(`
call in a deployed service's entrypoint emits Python's default unparseable
text format ("LEVEL:logger:message"), which DD's log pipeline cannot parse
a severity out of - it defaults EVERY line, including plain INFO, to
status:error. Found live in `consumer.py` (39097/39097 of grug-consumer's
7-day log volume misclassified) and the identical bug in
`personas/smasher/trial_janitor.py` - both fixed to call
`observability.configure_logging()` instead, the same JSON formatter
webhook/api/poller already use.

Same scan-source-tree shape as test_log_pii_guard.py.
